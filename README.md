Utility for parsing scrobbled content for commenting and possibly sharing

I listen to (and scrobble) a bunch of podcasts and music, this project is designed to help me revisit podcasts I've listed to recently, and make a few notes for re-sharing or just further contemplation.

It should separate podcast from music content, and put the two in a place I can easily do something with them later.
