# descrobbler
Utility for parsing scrobbled content for commenting and possibly sharing

I listen to (and scrobble) a bunch of podcasts and music, this project is designed to help me revisit podcasts I've listed to recently, and make a few notes for re-sharing or just further contemplation.

It should separate podcast from music content, and put the two in a place I can easily do something with them later.

## installation

Depends on lastfm_tools:
https://github.com/hugovk/lastfm-tools

```
pip install pylast
```

## ToDo

- Import user settings from a text file (including output file location)
- get track duration information
- discriminate between podcasts and music tracks
- store the output in a (mysql?) database
